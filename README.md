# LogIt
Beginning with version 0.6 of JS8Call Monitor, support is included for mapping QSOs reported through the JS8Call API "LOG.QSO" event. This event is generated from within the JS8Call application when submitting the Log QSO form.

The LogIt program is designed to emulate this behavior, through a separate GUI that is independent of JS8Call. The main purpose is to manually generate LOG.QSO events that will result in them being mapped by JS8Call Monitor. For example mapping a point of interest, or a QSO that occurred through another mode.
# Prerequisites
- Windows XP or higher.
- Version 0.6 or higher of JS8Call Monitor.
